peer Review Comments:

The website looks good, there is some text that starts all the way at the left side on the home page; not sure if that was intended or not. If you are on the suppliers page and attempt to go to the products page, it shows an error message; though it works fine when accessing it from the other pages. Mobile looks good as well though the products page in mobile doesn't seem responive with everything going off screen and not fitting the screen width. Other than those things I saw the website seems good, and the other pages are responsive for mobile!
